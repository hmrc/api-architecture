# MTD API Refactoring to Enable New Entity Types: Estimate



22 September 2020

- Toby Porter, MTD Front Facing API Architect
- Mark Kelly, MTD Front Facing API Technical Lead



## 1. Problem Statement

The current MTD ITSA individual APIs are not suitable to reuse for other entity types because they are tied to use of a nino. This makes delivery of additional return types expensive and time consuming.  We want to investigate the possibility of making a breaking change to the individual APIs to enable them to be reused for Trusts/Partnerships etc.



### 1.1 High Level Assumptions

1. There are [initially] 3 additional entities that need to be supported: Partnerships, Trusts & Pension Schemes
2. Return requirements are broadly the same as Individuals but may differ by 10%, 30% & 50% respectively i.e. Individuals is considered to be a super-set of Partnerships etc.
3. More entities may need to be supported in future
4. Calculations API would need minimal modifications



### 1.2 Definitions

- Sprint - One [development] sprint is two weeks in length



## 2. Approach

The strategic approach is to re-register all the existing *individuals* endpoints under entity agnostic contexts.

## 3. Risks & Issues

### 3.1 Risks



| #  | Risk                                      | Probability | Impact | Mitigation/Contingency                               |
| -- | :---------------------------------------- |:----------: | :----: | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. | Increased complexity and chance of creating new "monolithic" APIs if entity logic diverges | Med | High | Monitor and split if necessary... |
| 2. | API Platform reject the request for additional top level contexts | High | High | Start engagement with platform team and get backing of MTD programme if needed. (MTD APIs are the largest "customer") |
| 3. | Pushback from third party vendors who have developed against existing *individuals* endpoints (Expectations of 3PV for Partnerships) | Medium | Medium | Follow standard breaking change process of keeping deprecated endpoints available for 6mths |
| 4. | Entity agnostic URI paths potentially make it harder for third party vendors to explore and identify the correct API for their needs | Medium | Medium | More thorough guidance, more flexible grouping options on the API Platform (tagging?). |



### 3.2 Issues

| #    | Issue                                                        | Resolver                    | Resolution |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1.   | The API Platform require a level of specificity in the naming so that top-level contexts can be shared by other teams. | MTD API Team & API Platform |            |
| 2.   | How should the front facing APIs determine the type of entity? | CDIO                        |            |
| 3.   | What will be the impact on downstream systems DES, ITSD, ETMP etc | CDIO                        |            |
| 4.   | API authentication is currently based on enrolment ID of the individual which is mapped to the Nino.  Discovery work needed to understand the impact on this process. | CDIO/MTD API Team           |            |
