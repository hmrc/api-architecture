# Support request

You must read the information below before you submit a support request.

The MTD API team cannot help if your query is about:

- Fraud Prevention Headers
- Issues relating to OAuth2
- Subscribing or registering to use the API Platform, MTD enrolment, de-enrolment, registration for VAT, Beta services, etc
- Issues integrating with the API Platform (e.g. setting up an application/access)
- Code examples in a given programming language
- Business-related questions or processes pre MTD
- Scheduled maintenance windows and days
- Onboarding (e.g. registering)
- Performance metrics

For any of the above, you **must** contact the Software Developer Support Team directly at SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk.  The SDS Team do not monitor this repository.

This repository is for technical queries relating to the VAT API.  We can help with VAT-API technical queries only.

Common support questions and answers can be found on [VAT API Wiki](https://github.com/hmrc/vat-api/wiki/FAQ). You can also search for previous support questions [here](https://github.com/hmrc/vat-api/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=).
